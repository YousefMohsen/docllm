We need to discuss something.\nAssistant U.S. Attorney\nWest Palm Beach, FL 33401\nPho\nFax-\n----Original Message---\nFrom: Roy BLACK [mailto:\nSent: Monday, August 11, 2008 11:40 PM\nTo: (USAFLS)\nSubject: Jeffrey Epstein\n=: I have conferred with the lawyers on the team. They all thank you for agreeing to oppose any disclosure of the 9/24/07 agreement.\nWe firmly believe this document is not discoverable in the civil cases. However if the court rules against you on this we request that you\nfurther ask that any disclosure be subject to a strong protective order prohibiting dissemination to anyone except counsel to the petitioners.\nWe are particularly concerned because civil lawyers are more apt to publicize something like this than those of us who litigate on the\ncriminal side of the docket. You may recall one lawyer standing on the bridge to palm beach railing over his misconceptions of the case.\nThis is the typical vehicle they use to get more plaintiffs. You had also asked what documents were disclosed in the state court. As part of\ncounsels obligation to fully disclose any promises or inducements which led to the plea agreement, the 9/24/07 agreement was filed with\nthe court. It was filed under seal. Once again I want to re-assure you that Mr. Epstein and his counsel intend to stand by their agreements. If\nyou or anyone in the USAO have any concern about a possible breach please call or email me again so we can discuss any dispute or\nmisunderstanding and allay any concerns. Thanks again.

Consequently, yourletter indicates\nthat you\nwill be presenting only two\nfacts to\nthe Court, namely:\nthere\nare no charges\nin\nthe District Court\nfi\nled\nagainst Jeffrey Epstein; and\n(2) Jeffrey\nEpstein entered pleas\nof guilty\nin\nFlorida State\nCourt on\nJune 30,\n2008, was sentenced, and\nis\nnow\nimprisoned in Palm Beach County.\nWe\ncan\ncertainly agree to those two facts.\nI\nam\nwriting to see whether you would\nalso\nbe\nwilling to include two additional uncontested facts in your Notice to the Court.\nThe facts we would like you to include are:\n(3) As a\nresult\nof\nthe guilty pleas in Florida\nState Court entered on\nJune 30,2008, there is currently\nin\nplace\na \"non-prosecution\" agreement between Jeffrey Epstein\nand the U.S.\nAttorney's\nOffice for the Southern District\nof\nFlorida that precludes filing\nof\nfederal criminal charges against Jeffrey Epstein for federal\nsex crimes committed against\nthe victims in this matter.\n(4) While this non-prosecution agreement was negotiated between the U.S.\nAttorney's Office and Jeffrey Epstein in September 2007 (and amended twice more\nduring that year), the victims and their attorneys were not told about the non-prosecution\nagreement until after June 30, 2008, because of an express confidentiality provision in the\nagreement that the U.S. Attorney's Office, the FBI, and other federal agents all complied\nwith.\n,\n\tHOLLYWOOD, PLOkiDA 33020\nEFTA00014125\n\n-- 1 of 2 --\n\nAJg. 1. 200E 12:30814 77\nAUSA\nUnited States Attorney's Office\nPage Two\nIn suggesting these stipulations, I am not foreclosing presenting other facts on\nbehalf of the victims if the Court determines that other facts are necessary to have before\nthe Court in order to effectively rule on these issues. It just seems to me that points (3)\nand (4) are so obviously uncontested, that your office would be willing to stipulate to\nthem and make those facts available to the Court for consideration.\nIt is unclear from your recent letter whether you intend to give the victims the\ncourtesy of seeing the fiill and complete non-prosecution agreement that was signed by\nthe parties and that now covers their case. Your previous proposed stipulation of\nundisputed facts stated: \"On July 9, 2008, AUSA sent a victim notification to\nJane Doe #1 via her attorney, Bradley Edwards, which is attached as Exhibit 6 to the\nDeclaration. That notification contains a written explanation of the full terms\nof the agreement between Epstein and the U.S. Attorney's Office.\" While it appears by\nthis statement to have been your intent to provide the victims with a true and accurate\ncopy of that non-prosecution agreement, that agreement has not yet been produced to\nthem. While it is likely a mere oversight on your part, we would again request a true and\naccurate copy of the complete non-prosecution agreement that apparently bars federal\nprosecution of the man who committed sexual crimes against my clients.\nAdditionally, we would request again that if statements of my clients were taken\nby FBI agents or your office, that those interview reports containing those statements he\nproduced to us. Finally, I continue to request that you assist the victims in this case by\nsecuring a transcript of the hearing on their petition. Your letter did not address that\nrequest, and we would hope that your office would assist the innocent and indigent\nvictims in this ease by providing that transcript.\nThank you for your attention to these concerns.\nSincerely,\nBE/sg Brad Edwards\nHOLLYWOOD, FLORIDA 330 20\nEFTA00014126\n\n-- 2 of 2 --",

I write to follow up on some of the points that\nyou raised.\nThe list of thirty-two victims that was provided to Mr. Goldberger via certified mail on\nJuly 10, 2008 is the final list. As I mentioned, copies of the notification letters to each victim will\nbe carbon-copied to an attorney for Mr. Epstein and Mr. Josefsberg. I asked you to advise me\nwhether Mr. Goldberger should continue to be listed as the contact person for the civil litigation\nin the amended victim notification letters and whether he should receive the carbon copies of\nthose letters as they are sent.\nI also asked you to provide me with written confirmation of your agreement to pay Mr.\nJosefsberg's fees. Please provide me with that confirmation so that Mr. Josefsberg can begin his\nrepresentation.\nI have conferred with the lead AUSA in the case of Jane Doe 1 and 2 v. United States , and\nhe agrees that, based upon the discussion with Judge Marra during the hearing on the plaintiffs'\nmotion, a notification of the judge's ruling is required. I will, however, change the language\nslightly to direct the victims to discuss the matter with Mr. Josefsberg.\nWith regard to your concerns with my \"open-ended description of Mr. Epstein's\nresponsibilities regarding civil restitution,\" I agree that the resolution of civil damages claims is\nas stated in paragraphs 7 and 8 of the Agreement and Addendum. That is why the language in the\nnotification is taken verbatim from paragraphs 7, 8, and 7C of the Agreement and Addendum,\nexcept that the victim's name is used in place of \"identified individual.\" As I mentioned in my\nearlier letter, if you have any proposed substantive changes, please provide them to me.\nMr. Goldberger and Mr. Tein explicitly approved the language in my earlier victim\nnotification letter, even though they apparently were taking the position that the December 19,\n2007 letter was not part of the Agreement, so that misinformation was provided to the victims\nwith the approval of Mr. Epstein's attorneys.\nWith regard to your sixth and seventh points, I reiterate that it is the Office's position that\nthe Agreement and Addendum speak for themselves. Let me also reiterate that, while the Office\ndoes not intend to involve itself in any civil negotiations or litigation, if it comes to our attention\nEFTA00014144\n\n-- 1 of 2 --\n\nthat Mr. Epstein has breached the terms of the Agreement, the Office intends to enforce its right\nto indict Mr. Epstein.\nI would appreciate a prompt response to the question regarding which of Mr. Epstein's\nattorneys should be named in and receive copies of the notification letters, as well as\ndocumentation of your commitment to paying Mr. Josefsberg's fees so that I may begin\ndistributing the revised victim notifications on Wednesday morning.\nSincerely,\nR.

I graduated from the University of California at Berkeley School of Law\n2.\n(Boalt Hall) in 1993. After serving as a judicial clerk to the Hon. in Sacramento,\nCalifornia, I was admitted to practice in California in 1995. I also am admitted to practice in all\ncourts of the states of Minnesota and Florida, the Eighth, Eleventh, and Federal Circuit Courts of\nAppeals, and the U.S. District Courts for the Southern District of Florida, the District of Minnesota,\nand the Northern District of California. My bar admission status in California and Minnesota is\ncurrently inactive. I am currently employed as an Assistant United States Attorney in the Southern\nDistrict of Florida and was so employed during all of the events described herein.\nI am the Assistant United States Attorney assigned to the investigation of Jeffrey\nEpstein. The case was investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\"FBI\"). The federal\ninvestigation was initiated in 2006 at the request of the Palm Beach Police Department (\"PBPD\")\ninto allegations that Jeffrey Epstein and his personal assistants had used facilities of interstate\ncommerce to induce young girls between the ages of thirteen and seventeen to engage in prostitution,\namongst other offenses.\nThroughout the investigation, when a victim was identified, victim notification letters\nwere provided to her both from your Affiant and from the FBI's Victim-Witness Specialist. Attached\nhereto are copies of the letters provided to Bradley Edwards' three clients,\nYour Affiant's letter to IM was provided by the FBI. (Ex. 1). Your Affiant's letter to was\nhand-delivered by myself to at the time that she was interviewed (Ex. 2). F2 Both Eland\nalso received letters from the FBI's Victim-Witness Specialist, which were sent on January 10,\n2008 (Exs. 3 & 4). ■was identified via the FBI's investigation in 2007, but she initially refused to\nspeak with investigators. s status as a victim of a federal offense was confirmed when she was\nEFTA00014146\n\n-- 1 of 4 --\n\ninterviewed by federal agents on May 28, 2008. The FBI's Victim-Witness Specialist sent a letter to\nM. on May 30, 2008 (Ex. 5).\n3. Throughout the investigation, the FBI agents, the FBI's Victim-Witness Specialist, and\nyour Affiant had contact with Mland Attorney Edwards' other client, MI, was represented\nby counsel and, accordingly, all contact with was made through that attorney. That attorney was\nJames Eisenberg, and his fees were paid by Jeffrey Epstein, the target of the investigation. Fs\n4. In the summer of 2007, Mr. Epstein and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern\nDistrict of Florida (\"the Office\") entered into negotiations to resolve the investigation. At that time,\nMr. Epstein had been charged by the State of Florida with solicitation of prostitution, in violation of\nFlorida Statutes § 796.07. Mr. Epstein's attorneys sought a global resolution of the matter. The\nUnited States subsequently agreed to defer federal prosecution in favor of prosecution by the State of\nFlorida, so long as certain basic preconditions were met. One of the key objectives for the\nGovernment was to preserve a federal remedy for the young girls whom Epstein had sexually\nexploited. Thus, one condition of that agreement, notice of which was provided to the victims on\nJuly 9, 2008, is the following:\n\"Any person, who while a minor, was a victim of a violation of an offense enumerated in\nTitle 18, United States Code, Section 2255, will have the same rights to proceed under\nSection 2255 as she would have had, if Mr. Epstein had been tried federally and convicted\nof an enumerated offense. For purposes of implementing this paragraph, the United States\nshall provide Mr. Epstein's attorneys with a list of individuals whom it was prepared to\nname in an Indictment as victims of an enumerated offense by Mr. Epstein. Any judicial\nauthority interpreting this provision, including any authority determining which\nevidentiary burdens if any a plaintiff must meet, shall consider that it is the intent of the\nparties to place these identified victims in the same position as they would have been had\nMr. Epstein been convicted at trial. No more; no less.\"\n1. An agreement was reached in September 2007. The Agreement contained an express\nconfidentiality provision.\n2. Although individual victims were not consulted regarding the agreement, several had\nexpressed concerns regarding the exposure of their identities at trial and they desired a prompt\nresolution of the matter. At the time the agreement was signed in September 2007, was openly\nhostile to the prosecution of Epstein. The FBI attempted to interview ■in October 2007, at which\ntime she refused to provide any information regarding Jeffrey Epstein. None of Attorney Edwards'\nclients had expressed a desire to be consulted prior to the resolution of the federal investigation.\nEFTA00014147\n\n-- 2 of 4 --\n\n3. As explained above, one of the terms of the agreement deferring prosecution to the\nState of Florida was securing a federal remedy for the victims. In October 2007, shortly after the\nagreement was signed, four victims were contacted and these provisions were discussed. One of\nthose victims was ■ who at the time was not represented, and she was given notice of the\nagreement. Notice was also provided of an expected change of plea in October 2007. When\nEpstein's attorneys learned that some of the victims had been notified, they complained that the\nvictims were receiving an incentive to overstate their involvement with Mr. Epstein in order to\nincrease their damages claims. While your Affiant knew that the victims' statements had been taken\nand corroborated with independent evidence well before they were informed of the potential for\ndamages, the agents and I concluded that informing additional victims could compromise the\nwitnesses' credibility at trial if Epstein reneged on the agreement.\n4. After had been notified of the terms of the agreement, but before Epstein\nperformed his obligations, contacted the FBI because Epstein's counsel was attempting to take\nher deposition and private investigators were harassing her. Your Affiant secured pro bono counsel to\nrepresent and several other identified victims. Pro bono counsel was able to assist in\navoiding the improper deposition. That pro bono counsel did not express to your Affiant that\nwas dissatisfied with the resolution of the matter.\n5. In mid-June 2008, Attorney Edwards contacted your Affiant to inform me that he\nrepresented and and asked to meet to provide me with information regarding Epstein. I\ninvited Attorney Edwards to send to me any information that he wanted me to consider. Nothing was\nprovided. I also advised Attorney Edwards that he should consider contacting the State Attorney's\nOffice, if he so wished. I understand that no contact with that office was made. Attorney Edwards\nhad alluded to so I advised him that, to my knowledge, ■ was still represented by Attorney\nJames Eisenberg.\n6. On Friday, June 27, 2008, at approximate 4:15 p.m., your Affiant received a copy of the\nproposed state plea agreement and learned that the plea was scheduled for 8:30 a.m., Monday, June\n30, 2008. Your Affiant and the Palm Beach Police Department attempted to provide notification to\nvictims in the short time that Epstein's counsel had given us. Although all known victims were not\nnotified, your Affiant specifically called attorney Edwards to provide notice to his clients regarding\nthe hearing. Your Affiant believes that it was during this conversation that Attorney Edwards\nEFTA00014148\n\n-- 3 of 4 --\n\nnotified me that he represented and I assumed that he would pass on the notice to her, as well.\nAttorney Edwards informed your Affiant that he could not attend but that someone would be present\nat the hearing. Your Affiant attended the hearing, but none of Attorney Edwards' clients was present.\n7. On today's date, your Affiant provided the attached victim notifications to and\n■ via their attorney, Bradley Edwards. A notification was not provided to because the U.S.\nAttorney's modification limited Epstein's liability to victims whom the United States was prepared to\nname in an indictment. In light of -s prior statements to law enforcement, your Affiant could not\nin good faith include■ as a victim in an indictment and, accordingly, could not include her in the\nlist provided to Epstein's counsel.\n8. Furthermore, with respect to the Certification of Emergency, Attorney Edwards did not\never contact me prior to the filing of that Certification to demand the relief that he requests in his\nEmergency Petition. On the afternoon of July 7, 2008, after your Affiant had already received the\nCertification of Emergency and Emergency Petition, I received a letter from Attorney Edwards that\nhad been sent, via Certified Mail, on July 3, 2008. While that letter urges the Attorney General and\nthe United States Attorney to consider \"vigorous\nenforcement\" of federal laws with respect to Jeffrey Epstein, it contains no demand for the relief\nrequested in the Emergency Petition.\n1. I declare under penalty of perjury, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746 that the foregoing is\ntrue and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.\nExecuted this day of July, 2008.\nAttorney Edwards filed his Motion on behalf of \"Jane Doe,\" without identi ing which of his clients is\nthe purported victim. Accordingly, I will address facts related to All three of those clients\nwere victims of Jeffrey Epstein's while they were minors beginning when they were fifteen years old.\naPlease note that the dates on the U.S. Attorney's Office letters to I are not the dates that\nthe letters were actually delivered. Letters to all known victims were prepared early in the investigation and\ndelivered as each victim was contacted.\nF3The undersigned does not know when Mr. Edwards began representing or whether ever\nformally terminated Mr. Eisenberg's representation.\nEFTA00014149\n\n-- 4 of 4 --",
